# SecureCalculator
Welcome to the landing page for a simple, secure calculator you can use to perform all types of calculations-and at all times!

<b>Have you been told that you should learn to do mental math because you are not always going to have a calculator available to you?</b></br>

Quick look in your pockets! I can almost guarantee that you have a smartphone capable of "doing more math" than your feeble brain could ever do. Today's phones are more powerful than the computers that took the astronauts to the Moon. So why can we not utilize all the available resources on test and exams? Professors require students to bring in a separate utility costing up $150 that we may use sparingly and almost certainly only in an academic setting. With the rise in popularity of Wolfram Alpha and other digital calculation tools we humbly release SecureCalculator. </br>

To the student, we offer a calculator that you can use in all facets of life saving you time, money, and stress.</br>
To the teacher, we offer a secure utility that you can safely allow in your classrooms without worry of cheating.
